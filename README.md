# Hotstar_Server_Launching
I have developed Hotstar_Server_Launching project using Python Machine Learning over AWS Cloud by my own idea. In this project i have developed an algorithm which can handle when there is a huge traffic using gestures we can launch the servers so that any user cannot get interrupted in streaming applications like Hotstar during World Cup.
